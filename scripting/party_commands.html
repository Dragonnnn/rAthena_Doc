<h2 id='getpartyname'>getpartyname</h2>
<p>

<code>getpartyname(<party id>)</code>

This function will return the name of a party that has the specified ID number. 
If there is no such party ID, "null" will be returned.

Lets say the ID of a party was saved as a global variable:

    // This would return the name of the party from the ID stored in a variable
    mes "You're in the '"+getpartyname($@var)+"' party, I know!";

</p>
<h2 id='getpartymember'>getpartymember</h2>
<p>

<code>getpartymember <party id>{,<type>};</code>

This command will find all members of a specified party and returns their names 
(or character id or account id depending on the value of "type") into an array
of temporary global variables. There's actually quite a few commands like this
which will fill a special variable with data upon execution and not do anything
else.

Upon executing this,

$@partymembername$[] is a global temporary string array which contains all the 
                     names of these party members
                     (only set when type is 0 or not specified)

$@partymembercid[]   is a global temporary number array which contains the 
                     character id of these party members.
                     (only set when type is 1)

$@partymemberaid[]   is a global temporary number array which contains the 
                     account id of these party members.
                     (only set when type is 2)

$@partymembercount   is the number of party members that were found.

The party members will (apparently) be found regardless of whether they are 
online or offline. Note that the names come in no particular order.

Be sure to use $@partymembercount to go through this array, and not 
'getarraysize', because it is not cleared between runs of 'getpartymember'. If 
someone with 7 party members invokes this script, the array would have 7 
elements. But if another person calls up the NPC, and he has a party of 5, the 
server will not clear the array for you, overwriting the values instead. So in 
addition to returning the 5 member names, the 6th and 7th elements from the last 
call remain, and you will get 5+2 members, of which the last 2 don't belong to 
the new guy's party. $@partymembercount will always contain the correct number, 
(5) unlike 'getarraysize()' which will return 7 in this case.

Example 1: list party member names

	// get the party member names
	getpartymember getcharid(1),0;
	
	// It's a good idea to copy the global temporary $@partymember***** 
	// variables to your own scope variables because if you have pauses in this 
	// script (sleep, sleep2, next, close2, input, menu, select, or prompt), 
	// another player could click this NPC, trigger 'getpartymember', and 
	// overwrite the $@partymember***** variables.
	.@count = $@partymembercount;
	copyarray .@name$[0], $@partymembername$[0], $@partymembercount;
	
	// list the party member names
	for (.@i = 0; .@i < .@count; .@i++)
		mes (.@i +1) + ". ^0000FF" + .@name$[.@i] + "^000000";
	close;


Example 2: check party count (with a 'next' pause), before warping to event

	.register_num = 5; // How many party members are required?
	
	// get the charID and accountID of character's party members
	getpartymember getcharid(1), 1;
	getpartymember getcharid(1), 2;
	
	if ( $@partymembercount != .register_num ) {
		mes "Please form a party of "+ .register_num +" to continue";
		close;
	}
	
	// loop through both and use 'isloggedin' to count online party members
	for ( .@i = 0; .@i < $@partymembercount; .@i++ )
		if ( isloggedin( $@partymemberaid[.@i], $@partymembercid[.@i] ) )
			.@count_online++;

	// We search accountID & charID because a single party can have multiple 
	// characters from the same account. Without searching through the charID, 
	// if a player has 2 characters from the same account inside the party but 
	// only 1 char online, it would count their online char twice.
	
	if ( .@count_online != .register_num ) {
		mes "All your party members must be online to continue";
		close;
	}
	
	// copy the array to prevent players cheating the system
	copyarray .@partymembercid, $@partymembercid, .register_num;
	
	mes "Are you ready ?";
	next; // careful here
	select("Yes");
	
	// When a script hits a next, menu, sleep or input that pauses the script, 
	// players can invite or /leave and make changes in their party. To prevent 
	// this, we call getpartymember again and compare with the original values.
	
	getpartymember getcharid(1), 1;
	if ( $@partymembercount != .register_num ) {
		mes "You've made changes to your party !";
		close;
	}
	for ( .@i = 0; .@i < $@partymembercount; .@i++ ) {
		if ( .@partymembercid[.@i] != $@partymembercid[.@i] ) {
			mes "You've made changes to your party !";
			close;
		}
	}
	
	// Finally, it's safe to start the event!
	warpparty "event_map", 0,0, getcharid(1);

<h2 id='getpartyleader'>getpartyleader</h2>
<p>

<code>getpartyleader(<party id>{,<type>})</code>

This function returns some information about the given party-id's leader.
When type is omitted, the default information retrieved is the leader's name.
Possible types are:

	1: Leader account id
	2: Leader character id
	3: Leader's class
	4: Leader's current map name
	5: Leader's current level as stored on the party structure (may not be
	   current level if leader leveled up recently).

If retrieval fails (leader not found or party does not exist), this function
returns "null" instead of the character name, and -1 for the other types.

</p>
<h2 id='party_create'>party_create</h2>
<p>

<code>party_create("<party name>"{,<character id>{,<item share>,<item share type>}});</code>

Organizes a party with the attached or specified character as leader. If
successful, the command returns 1 and sets the global temporary variable
"$@party_create_id" to the ID of the party created.

Additionally, item sharing options can be provided:
 - Item Share: 0-Each Take (default), 1-Party Share
 - Item Share Type: 0-Each Take (default), 1-Even Share

These values are returned upon failure:
 0: Unknown error.

-2: Player already has a party.
-3: Party name exists.

</p>
<h2 id='party_destroy'>party_destroy</h2>
<p>

<code>party_destroy(<party id>);</code>
