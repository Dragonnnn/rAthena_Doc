			<h3 id='Loading_Script'>Loading Script</h3>
			<p>Scripts are loaded by the map server as referenced in the '<kbd>conf/</kbd><samp>map_athena.conf</samp>' 
configuration file, but in the default configuration, it doesn't load any script 
files itself. Instead, it loads the file 'npc/scripts_main.conf' which itself 
contains references to other files. The actual scripts are loaded from txt 
files, which are linked up like this:</p>
			<code><samp>npc:</samp> <kbd>&lt;path to a filename&gt;</kbd></code>
			<p>Any line like this, invoked, ultimately, by 'map_athena.conf' will load up the 
script contained in this file, which will make the script available. No file 
will get loaded twice, to prevent possible errors.</p>
			<p>Another configuration file option of relevance is:</p>
			<code><var>delnpc:</var> <kbd>&lt;path to a filename&gt;</kbd></code>
			<p>This will unload a specified script filename from memory, which, while 
seemingly useless, may sometimes be required.</p>
			<h3 id='Comment'>Comment</h3>
			<p>Whenever '<var>//</var>' is encountered in a line upon reading, everything beyond this on 
that line is considered to be a comment and is ignored. This works wherever you 
place it.</p>
			<code><var>//</var> This line will be ignored when processing the script.</code>
			<p>Block comments can also be used, where you can place <var>/*</var> and <var>*/</var> between any text you 
wish rAthena to ignore.</p>
			<code><var>/*</var> This text,<br/>
&nbsp;* no matter which new line you start<br/>
&nbsp;* is ignored, until the following<br/>
&nbsp;* symbol is encountered: <var>*/</var>
<br/>
<br/>
<var>/*</var> The leading *<br/>
&nbsp;in front of each line is a personal preference,<br/>
&nbsp;and is not required.<var>*/</var></code>
			<h3 id='GID'>GID</h3>
			<p>Most scripting commands and functions will want to request data about a 
character, store variables referenced to that character, send stuff to the 
client connected to that specific character. Whenever a script is invoked by a 
character, it is passed a so-called RID - this is the account ID number of a 
character that caused the code to execute by clicking on it, walking into its 
OnTouch zone, or otherwise.</p>
			<p>If you are only writing common NPCs, you don't need to bother with it. However, 
if you use functions, if you use timers, if you use clock-based script 
activation, you need to be aware of all cases when a script execution can be 
triggered without a RID attached. This will make a lot of commands and functions 
unusable, since they want data from a specific character, want to send stuff to 
a specific client, want to store variables specific to that character, and they 
would not know what character to work on if there's no RID.</p>
			<p>Unless you use 'attachrid' to explicitly attach a character to the script first.</p>
			<p>Whenever we say 'invoking character', we mean 'the character who's RID is 
attached to the running script. The script function "playerattached" can be
used to check which is the currently attached player to the script (it will
return 0 if the there is no player attached or the attached player no longer
is logged on to the map-server).</p>
			<h3 id='RID'>RID</h3>
			<p>GID stands for the Game ID of something, this can either be the GID obtained
through mobspawn (mob control commands) or the account ID of a character.
Another way would be to right click on a mob, 
NPC or char as GM sprited char to view the GID.</p>
			<p>This is mostly used for the new version of skill and the mob control commands
implemented.</p>
			<h3 id='Item_and_Pet_Script'>Item and Pet Scripts</h3>
			<p>Each item in the item database has three special fields - Script , OnEquip_Script
and OnUnequip_Script. The first is script code run every time a character equips the item, 
with the RID of the equipping character. Every time they unequip an item, all 
temporary bonuses given by the script commands are cleared, and all the scripts 
are executed once again to rebuild them. This also happens in several other 
situations (like upon login) but the full list is currently unknown.</p>
			<p>OnEquip_Script is a piece of script code run whenever the item is used by a character 
by double-clicking on it. OnUnequip_Script runs whenever the
equipment is unequip by a character</p>
			<p>Not all script commands work properly in the item scripts. Where commands and 
functions are known to be meant specifically for use in item scripts, they are 
described as such.</p>
			<p>Every pet in the pet database has a PetScript field, which determines pet 
behavior. It is invoked wherever a pet of the specified type is spawned. 
(hatched from an egg, or loaded from the char server when a character who had 
that pet following them connects) This may occur in some other situations as 
well. Don't expect anything other than commands definitely marked as usable in 
pet scripts to work in there reliably.</p>
			<h3 id='Numbers'>Numbers</h3>
			<p>Beside the common decimal numbers, which are nothing special whatsoever (though
do not expect to use fractions, since ALL numbers are integer in this language), 
the script engine also handles hexadecimal numbers, which are otherwise 
identical. Writing a number like '0x&lt;hex digits&gt;' will make it recognized as a 
hexadecimal value. Notice that 0x10 is equal to 16. Also notice that if you try 
to 'mes 0x10' it will print '16'.

Number values can't exceed the limits of an integer variable: Any number
greater than INT_MAX (2147483647) or smaller than INT_MIN (&minus;2147483648) will
be capped to those values and will cause a warning to be reported.</p>
			<code>.@var = <var>1</var>;<br/>
				.@var = <var>-219</var>;<br/>
				.@var = <dfn>0xFF0000</dfn>;<br/>
			</code>
			<p class='important'><strong>NOTE: </strong>DO NOT use quote (<strong>&quot; ... &quot;</strong>) for number!</p>
